<h1>Tags</h1>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> are labels associated to documents.</p>
<p>A document can be tagged by multiple tags, and a tag can be applied to multiple documents.</p>
<p>Using the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> button, you can edit permissions on a tag.</p>
<p>If a tag can be read by another user or group, associated documents can also be read by those people.</p>
<p>For example, tag your company documents with a tag <span class="label label-info">MyCompany</span> and add the permission <strong>Read</strong> to a group <span class="btn btn-default">employees</span></p>
